# SQL and Analytics Bootcamp

Welcome to our SQL and Analytics Bootcamp, an intensive program designed to equip you with data engineering and data analysis skills. 

Our bootcamp is packed with resources and interactive activities to ensure a hands-on learning experience. Here are the main components of our program:

#### 1. **Repository in Excalidraw**

* **Link:** [Excalidraw](https://link.excalidraw.com/l/8pvW6zbNUnD/3ktnOgfFeRK)
* **Objective:** Conceptualize and graphically expose data structures, workflows and system architectures.

* **Description:** The repository in Excalidraw serves as a visual tool to better understand the abstract and complex concepts you will encounter in the course. Here, you will have access to diagrams and schemes that clearly and effectively illustrate engineering and data analysis topics, facilitating understanding and learning.
